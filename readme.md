# Messaging Platform Application
## There are two different implementation of the application

 - ### Single Pid (running by single process)
 - ### Multiple Pid (running by multiple processes)

## In The root folder you could find the `run.sh` script which runs two applications just one by one
## You could run them separately by `runsinglepid.sh` or `runmultiplepid.sh` but in that case you should package the `jar` file manually before you do it.

## Also there is strong requirement to start the application, you should have jdk version-17 installed locally.

# Please, enjoy it :)
